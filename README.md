# record2Wave
A sample about wavesurfer.js .
Aim to draw a wave image by a record which recorded by page recorder

I prefer to export that image rather than create a player by wavesurfer.js.
However,every time I use the export method ,it always return a empty data uri.
If you know how to do this ,please commit soon,thks
